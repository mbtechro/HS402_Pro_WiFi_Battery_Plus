# HS402_Pro_WiFi_Battery_Plus


This is my new design for an all in one HS402 PRO based oscilloscope, designed to be used either connected to your Android device either wireless via WiFi.
It includes a Li-Ion battery, a battery charging circuit and the needed protection to ensure a safe operation of the Li-Ion battery.
As usual, all my custom builds use a USB type B connector in order to ensure enhanced robustness on the daily usage in your workshop.

Development is in progress and first results related to device performance will be available soon.

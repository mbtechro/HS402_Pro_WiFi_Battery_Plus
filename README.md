# HS402_Pro_WiFi_Battery_Plus


This is my new design for an all in one HS402 PRO based oscilloscope, designed to be used either connected to your Android device either wireless via WiFi.

It includes a Li-Ion battery, a battery charging circuit, and the needed protections to ensure a safe operation of the Li-Ion battery (both for the operator and the battery itself).

As usual, all my custom builds use a USB type B connector in order to ensure enhanced robustness on the daily usage in your workshop.


Development is in progress and first results related to device performance will be available soon.

**Next steps:**

Execute and finish the testing of the first batch,

Caracterize the device from the performance point of view,

Design freeze of the device enclosure,

Design and build the tools for fast flashing and testing,


**Meanwhile:**

Launch a website for preorders,

Build and tests first orders,

Deliver first orders,



**Thanks!**
